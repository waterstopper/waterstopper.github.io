## [Regina Programming Language](https://waterstopper.github.io/regina-ide)

Interpreter code compiles into JVM and Javascript. Main feature of the language are declarative classes: class properties can be deﬁned by other, not yet initialized properties and instances. Practical value of the language is in creation of concise SVG image generators. Additionally, the [documentation](https://waterstopper.github.io/regina/) was created.
