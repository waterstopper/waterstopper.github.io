## TLDR

Difference between other languages and ReGIna is dynamic instantiation. In
short, properties in classes will be assigned only after their dependencies are assigned, allowing
recursive properties
of same class `A` inside class `A`.

## Idea

Classes can have references to other classes inside them as
properties. These property-classes are evaluated dynamically. Take a look at this example:

```kotlin
class Node export rect {
    // export = false - can deny export
    iter = if (parent) parent.iter + 1 else 0

    childNode = if (iter == 5) Nothing() else Node()

    position = if (childNode is Node) \
    Position(childNode.position.x + 1, childNode.position.y) \
    else Position(0, 0)
}

fun main() {
    Node()
}
```

This will create following svg:

```svg

<svg>
    <rect x="4" y="0"/>
    <rect x="3" y="0"/>
    <rect x="2" y="0"/>
    <rect x="1" y="0"/>
    <rect x="0" y="0"/>
</svg>
```

First algorithm creates empty Node() (we'll call it *Node0*) from main(). Then, starting from top
to bottom:

1. algorithm assigns **iter** of *Node0* to 0 because parent returns 0 as an equivalent of null.
2. After that, **childNode** is assigned a new Node (*Node1*).
3. **position** cannot be assigned because **childNode.position** is not yet assigned. Algorithm
   goes to
   childNode.position, that is *Node1*.position and tries to assign it. However, childNode is
   required, so we go to *
   Node1*.childNode, which needs iter.

*It's not important to consider while assigning values, but it shows why there cannot be any cyclic
dependencies for properties*.

## How not to write code with dynamic instantiation

### Bad class function

```kotlin
class FunctionOveruse {
    prop = make()

    fun make() {
        FunctionOveruse()
        return prop
    }
}
```

Both lines in ```make()``` will execute forever.

To make functions as expressive as possible, it is important to allow class instantiating inside
them. If

We either make internal class functions (which is purely decompositional thing) or make
instantiating inside functions
possible (and ```fun main()``` as an entry point)
