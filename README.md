## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Alex5041/Alex5041.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
```python
from typing import Iterator

# This is an example
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
        """ Fibonacci series up to n """
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b

result = sum(Math.fib(42))
print("The answer is {}".format(result))
```
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Alex5041/Alex5041.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
