<h3 id="thread-problems">Thread problems</h3>
<p>Thread problems have names. Here are the most popular ones.</p>
<h4 id="deadlock">Deadlock</h4>
<p>N locks locked forever, waiting for each other. For instance, two
monitors are required to move further, and two threads have one monitor
taken. They both will be waiting until another monitor is freed, which
won’t happen. In Java there are no tools to identify deadlock.</p>
<h4 id="livelock">Livelock</h4>
<p>Threads interact with each other not performing any useful work.</p>
<h4 id="starvation">Starvation</h4>
<p>Thread waits for monitor access for too long, while other threads
access that monitor multiple times.</p>
<h3 id="useful-synchronization-object-methods">Useful synchronization
Object methods</h3>
<p>All following methods require a thread to have a monitor. Hence,
these methods can be used only in <code>synchronized</code>
block/method.</p>
<p><strong>wait()</strong>. When reaching this command, thread frees a
monitor and is put into a waiting list, pausing its execution. Usually
<code>wait()</code> is surrounded in a <code>while</code> cycle.</p>
<p><strong>notify()</strong>. Frees one random thread waiting for a
particular monitor and gives them a monitor.</p>
<p><strong>notifyAll()</strong>. Empties a waiting list of threads
waiting. A random thread gets a monitor, while all other threads go back
to waiting list. The only difference that I found out with
<code>notify()</code> is that with <code>notify()</code> JVM selects a
thread, with <code>notifyAll()</code> the system thread scheduler does
it. Probably system thread scheduler guarantees that all waiting threads
will, in some time, acquire lock, while JVM does not (it might
accidentally pick a subset of waiting threads all the time, putting
other threads to starvation).</p>
<h4 id="spurious-wakeups">Spurious wakeups</h4>
<p>Sometimes waiting threads can get out of a waiting list. This happens
due to specific thread implementations in different OS. Also thread can
be woken from an <code>interrupt()</code> call. That is one reason why
<code>wait()</code> should be surrounded in a <code>while</code> block -
to put spontaneously woken thread back into waiting.</p>
