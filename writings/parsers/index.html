    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Parsers</h1>
<p><em>As with the first article, I wrote this one on a computer,
because the topic is hard to tackle. I knew I would have to make a lot
of edits and rearrangements. So technically I’m two days behind my
schedule, but we’re just going to ignore that.</em></p>
<h1 id="parser-traits">Parser traits</h1>
<p>These traits are not exactly definitive features for a parser.
However, these definitions are often mentioned, so it’s good to know
what they mean.</p>
<h3 id="recursive-descent">Recursive descent</h3>
<p>Recursive descent parser is a program, where each <a
href="programming/introduction-to-grammars">grammar</a> rule is
implemented as a separate method. Sometimes all rules describing one
terminal are combined into a single method.</p>
<p><img src="/resources/writings/recursive_parser.svg" /></p>
<h3 id="back-tracking-and-non-back-tracking">Back-tracking and non
back-tracking</h3>
<p>Back-tracking parser looks some tokens behind to define a position of
current token in a tree. Non back-tracking parsers do not use previous
tokens.</p>
<h1 id="most-common-parser-classification">Most common parser
classification</h1>
<p>LL and LR are the most often mentioned parsers in this context. And
their distinct features are being top-down and bottom-up
respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="top-down-parser.">Top-down parser.</h3>
<p>This parser creates a tree from root to leaves.</p>
<h5 id="llk-parser">LL(k) parser</h5>
<p>Left-to-right, leftmost derivation. Parses tokens from left to right,
looking k tokens ahead. Uses context free grammar.</p>
<p>Can be implemented either as a recursive descent or a pushdown
automata.</p>
<p><em>Note: a subset of languages that can be parsed with LL(k) parser
is called LL(k) languages.</em></p>
<h3 id="bottom-up-parser.">Bottom-up parser.</h3>
<p>Unlike top-down, creates tree starting from leaves and finishing at
root.</p>
<h5 id="lrk-parser">LR(k) parser</h5>
<p>Left-to-right, rightmost derivation. Uses CFG. Starts with tokens of
higher priority, eventually building its way from leaves to root (the
higher the node, the less priority it has. Look at <a
href="programming/ast">AST arithmetic example</a>).</p>
<p>Implementation uses pushdown automata or deterministic finite
automation. Works in linear time.</p>
<h1 id="other-parsers">Other parsers</h1>
<h3 id="operator-precedence-parser">Operator precedence parser</h3>
<p>Is a parser for, you guessed it, operator precedence grammars. OP is
a CFG with no empty right-hand side rules and no rules with adjacent
non-terminals.</p>
<h5 id="operator-precedence-implementation">Operator precedence
implementation</h5>
<p>Pratt parser is a top-down operator precedence parser. This parser is
rarely mentioned. It is based on the idea of led, nud and std functions.
Each token has (or has not) led, nud and std functions. These functions
basically tell how this token is related to ones around it. All parsing
is embedded into these functions, with some additional ones: expression
and statement functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nud is null denotation, used for primary tokens like numbers and
identifiers and prefix operators</li>
<li>Led is left denotation, describe how a token relates to its left
neighbor. Used for infix</li>
<li>Std is statement denotation, is for statements: assignment, return
keyword</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="peg-parser">PEG parser</h4>
<p>Parser parsing expression grammar.</p>
<h5 id="peg-parser-implementation">PEG parser implementation</h5>
<p>Packrat parser implements recursive descent with infinite lookahead.
Requires more memory than LL parser, but supports left recursion.</p>
<p><em>I don’t think this is an exhaustive list of parsers, and it’s
shallow. However, it’s in sync with grammar post, one can be read after
another</em></p>
