    <h1 style="text-align: center;">A design draft for a text processing tool</h1>
<h1 id="problem-scope">Problem scope</h1>
<p>The idea is to create a tool (a “programming” language) for people
who have to do <strong>repetitive</strong> text processing tasks
<strong>often</strong>. The program will automate any text processing a
user did manually. If a task is not repetitive and is done in a
reasonable amount of time, then there is no need to automate it.</p>
<p>Inputs and outputs are mostly xlsx and docx files.</p>
<p>Program will be an almost natural-like language. Also I want to
create GUI where user can select parts of text and process text with
those selections (e.g. select name from one table, then spread the
selection for the whole column, find these names in the other files and
increment some corresponding column value in the file). This GUI won’t
be described in detail here, only the language. All actions in GUI
should have a counterpart in the language.</p>
<h1 id="use-cases">Use cases</h1>
<h2 id="weekly-excel-documents-processing">Weekly excel documents
processing</h2>
<p>We have a table “clients” with columns <code>name</code> (string),
<code>visit</code> (integer). Each week we get a table “week N” with
columns <code>name</code> (string) and <code>organization</code>
(string).</p>
<p>For each client where <code>organization</code> in “week N” isn’t
equal to <code>our_organization</code>, we need to increase visit in
“clients” by 1.</p>
<p>Here is an SQL-solution:</p>
<pre class="postgresql"><code>UPDATE clients c
SET c.visit = c.visit + 1 -- not sure it will work
FROM (
    SELECT name
    FROM weekN
    WHERE organization &lt;&gt; &quot;our_organization&quot;
    ) AS weekly
WHERE c.name = weekly.name</code></pre>
<p>Focus is specifically on tasks that involve 2 or more excel tables,
that cannot be solved with Excel.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-newspapers-movie-schedules">Parsing newspapers’ movie
schedules</h2>
<p>Having a text with many entries like
<code>"&lt;movieName1&gt;, &lt;movieName2&gt;": &lt;theaterName1&gt;, &lt;theaterName&gt;...</code>
for each date, create a table with three columns <code>theater</code>,
<code>movie</code>, <code>day count</code>, where <code>day count</code>
equals maximum consecutive days that that movie was shown in a
particular theater.</p>
<p>My girlfriend had that task, she had to process 2.5 months of such
data. So <a href="https://waterstopper.github.io/NewspaperParser/">I
wrote a program</a> that does most of the work (input text for each day,
get a table with results).</p>
<h1 id="restrictions-and-insights">Restrictions and insights</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>It should be a website</strong>. Some companies prohibit
third-party software installation, but a browser is installed
everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>It shouldn’t look like a programming language</strong>. I
did some research<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for inspiration and didn’t find good
analogues.</li>
<li><strong>It should be interpreted</strong> for almost zero-startup
times. Additionally it should have a kind of “debugging” environment
where user can look into intermediate results of execution.</li>
<li>Apparently <strong>it’s ok to have explicit and terse syntax for
same things</strong>, according to <a
href="https://www.thefeedbackloop.xyz/stroustrups-rule-and-layering-over-time/">Stroustrup’s
Rule</a>. There might be features like <code>expand</code> and
<code>shorten</code> to refactor such statmements into their long and
short counterparts.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="raw-draft-of-how-i-want-it-to-look">Raw draft of how I want it
to look:</h1>
<p>I want to have as few variables as possible, because I think it is a
low-level construct that isn’t necessary. Most of the time, a solution
to a text-processing problem can be described without explicit
variables.</p>
<h2 id="task-1">Task 1</h2>
<p>Task is described in <a
href="#weekly-excel-documents-processing">weekly documents
processing</a></p>
<pre><code>For each row in &quot;weekN&quot; filter row&#39;s &quot;organization&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;our_organization&quot;:
    If row&#39;s &quot;name&quot; exists in &quot;output&quot;: visit add 1. </code></pre>
<h2 id="task-2">Task 2</h2>
<p><a
href="https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/description/">Compress
strings</a>: <code>avvvdkwwwqm -&gt; av3dkw3qm</code></p>
<pre><code>replace sequences (seq) of equal symbols with: seq[0] + seq size; here seq is a variable for a sequence</code></pre>
<h2 id="task3">Task3</h2>
<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/">Check if
number is palindrome</a> (121 -&gt; true, 123 -&gt; false)</p>
<pre><code>it reverse equal it</code></pre>
<h1 id="why-ai-is-not-a-good-solution">Why AI is not a good
solution</h1>
<p>AI can solve the text processing problem in one of two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write code that solves text processing. Not a good solution, because
such code is hard to edit if you don’t know how to program.</li>
<li>Do some <em>blackboxy black magic</em> and output desired result.
This is not a good solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently I mark AI-solutions as unreliable, but that can change
quickly.</p>
<h1 id="seeking-help">Seeking help</h1>
<p>If you can contribute in any way (<a
href="mailto:kononal@gmail.com">kononal@gmail.com</a>):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provide any recurring text processing use-cases.</li>
<li>Provide examples of languages/libraries that tackle the problem
well.</li>
<li>Link any useful resources. What I found: https://proglangdesign.net/
for relevant resources and a list of some languages; <a
href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta code</a> for
solutions of tasks in different languages.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll be very grateful.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Recently I skimmed through a <a
href="https://proglangdesign.net/">list of programming languages</a> and
was frustrated with how most of them look identical and do identical
things (I was checking entries that might be close to what I’m trying to
create, not all of them). I was hoping to draw inspiration from these
languages. but the only interesting idea I found is in-code comments
from <a href="https://github.com/cognate-lang/cognate">Cognate</a>. Also
I found <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/icon/index.htm">Icon
language</a> from Paul Graham’s <a
href="https://paulgraham.com/power.html">post</a>. I like the generators
and condition expressions that return non-bool in Icon.<a href="#fnref1"
