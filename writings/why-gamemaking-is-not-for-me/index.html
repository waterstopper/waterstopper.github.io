    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why gamemaking is not for me</h1>
<p>TLDR: it is frustrating, initial idea and result have a huge
difference, because I associate my game ideas with emotions, that a
player feels during the game. When playing a made game I don’t feel
these emotions at all.</p>
<h3 id="game-feel">Game feel</h3>
<p>Game feel is the set of emotions that a person experiences during
play session. Game feel is subjective for everyone. It is <strong>the
only thing that defines game value<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-used-to-make-games">How I used to make games</h3>
<p>I came up with a spectacular game idea<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Not long time after, I imagine a default play session, what a player
should do, <strong>how he would feel</strong>. Right from the start I
merge game feel with an idea. And this is the path to failure.</p>
<p>Thing is, I’m a good engineer. I’m capable of implementing my game
idea. But I also expect that when playing a resulting game, I would
experience expected emotions. And it never happens. Probably, because it
is a job of a game designer.</p>

<h3 id="profession-of-a-game-designer">Profession of a game
designer</h3>
<p>I think game designer is responsible for the game feel. It’s a whole
field, that I know nothing about. Unlike me, a good game designer can
predict what emotions will a player feel during a game. Or, more
importantly, game designer knows, <strong>how</strong> to change an
existing product towards a better game feel.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>To prevent frustration, I shouldn’t connect ideas with emotions. If I
find an idea to be fun in my head, I should not expect it to be fun in
reality. There are two ways to be better at making fun games:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Learn some game design (not game creation)</li>
<li>Iterate, hoping that you are heading towards better game feel. Might
not work.</li>

<li id="fn1"><p>You might say: “What a bold statement! How about
beautiful graphics? Interesting mechanics? Don’t you think that a game
with a bad game feel is valuable because of its graphics?” No, I don’t.
In this case graphics are valuable by themselves. You evaluate graphics
from the point of its visual value. Therefore, if a game has a bad game
feel, it’s bad as a game, it’s not fun to play. All its parts might be
fine but game value is not defined by them in separate, important thing
is <strong>how all pieces together contribute to the emotions that a
player feels during the game</strong>.<a href="#fnref1"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>In this context, I refer to the <strong>game
idea</strong> as an interesting original mechanic, raw gameplay loop,
without much detail. I prototype this mechanic, because I think it would
be fun to play.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
