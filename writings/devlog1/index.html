<h3 id="what-is-a-symbol-table">What is a symbol table?</h3>
<p>Symbol table stores current program state. I separated it into three
levels, turning <code>SymbolTable</code> into a kind of
manager-facade:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>FileTable</strong>. Contains classes, objects and functions
in current file.</li>
<li><strong>variableTable</strong>. Contains functions and properties of
current instance (if <code>ClassA.someClassFunction()</code> is
resolved, instance of ClassA is a variableTable in current
<code>SymbolTable</code>). Variable table is not a special class, it’s
either a primitive or a class instance.</li>
<li><strong>ScopeTable</strong>. Contains all variables and arguments
for current function.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>I created global SymbolTable <code>globalTable</code> and global
<code>imports</code>. It was convenient at the time. All classes,
functions and objects are added to the <code>globalTable</code> during
semantic analysis. Superclasses are defined, imports too. Semantic
analysis is performed for initial file and all its dependencies (they
are files). It is handy to write imports and file contents to global
variables. But when I started writing tests, it backfired.</p>
<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>
<p>When running a program once, evaluation is done once. However, when
running tests, evaluation runs many times. It lead to all kinds of
issues:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Functions appeared twice, especially mains, because main in current
file and main from previous failed session were saved.</li>
<li>Phantom functions were called from unclean imports</li>
</ol>
<p>To fix that, I added <code>clear()</code> function to make global
Table a blank table and delete all imports. It is called at the end of
<code>evaluate()</code> and <code>eval()</code> (which is a light
version of <code>evaluate()</code>). But it was treating a symptom, not
dealing with a problem. I plan to make it possible to run multiple
threads in parallel. So I need to remove these globals. Probably I can
create an array of global tables, each thread will write to a separate
table, although I would like to make stateless code, not add another
crutch.</p>
<p>Then I discovered same problems with tests that check failure
behavior. Particularly check whether exceptions are thrown correctly. It
appeared they did, however a clean program state wasn’t restored after.
Exception was thrown, but <code>globalTable</code> and
<code>imports</code> weren’t cleared after. I added <code>clear()</code>
on <code>PositionalException</code> initialization.</p>
<h3 id="future-work">Future work</h3>
<p>Add <code>imports</code> to <code>FileTable</code> as a property.
Remove <code>globalTable</code> and pass it as an argument.</p>
